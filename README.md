# Euclidean_4D_Visualizer
A Tool, To Visualize the 4-Dimensional Euclidean(not space-time) Objects In 3-Dimensional Euclidean Space.


Project Euclidean 4D objects to 2D Screen and rotate around any of the 4D planes and 3D axis to understand the concept of 4 Dimensions.

To understand more about 4D Euclidean Space:

For brief intro about the 4D and this project check [The Presentation](4D_visualizer.pdf) and for brainstorming about implementing the project see [The Old Readme file](4D_Readme_old.txt)

Usage: python 4dTo2d.py 4D-objects/tesseract.obj

Navigation Keys:
* up/down/left/right -> 3D rotation around axis; 
* i,o,k,l,",","." -> 4D rotation around plane; 
* enter -> reset;
* q -> quit
